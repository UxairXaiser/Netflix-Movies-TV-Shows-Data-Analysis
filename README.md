# Netflix Movies & TV Shows Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs an in-depth analysis of Netflix Movies and TV Shows using Python. It utilizes data analysis techniques to extract insights, trends, and patterns, including:

- Most frequent release years.
- Directors with the highest number of movies.
- Movies and TV shows distribution by category.
- Duration-based filtering of movies.
- Visualization of trends using charts.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains information about Netflix content, including:
- **Title**: Name of the Movie/TV Show.
- **Director**: Name of the director.
- **Cast**: Leading actors in the content.
- **Country**: Country where the movie/show was produced.
- **Release Year**: Year of release.
- **Duration**: Length of the movie (in minutes) or number of seasons.
- **Listed In**: Genre/category of the content.

## 🚀 Features Implemented
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values.
   - Formatting column values.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Identifying trends in content release.
   - Finding the most common genres.
   - Director analysis based on movie count.
3. **Conditional Filtering**
   - Movies belonging to a specific genre with a duration filter.
   - TV shows with multiple seasons.
4. **Grouping & Sorting Data**
   - Grouping data by year and content type.
   - Sorting data to find the most frequent directors and genres.
5. **Data Visualization**
   - Bar charts for movie releases by year.
   - Pie charts for movies vs. TV show distribution.
   - Line charts for genre-based trends.
   - Boxplots for duration analysis.

## 📊 Visualization Examples
The analysis includes various visualizations to better understand the data:

- **Bar Chart**: Number of movies and TV shows released per year.
- **Line Chart**: Trend of Comedy movies released over time.
- **Pie Chart**: Distribution of Movies vs. TV Shows.
- **Box Plot**: Distribution of movie durations by genre.
